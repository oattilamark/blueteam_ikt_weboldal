<h1>Audi Sport quattro</h1>
    <p>The Audi Sport quattro is a sports car from Audi, the first 1983 on the IAA was presented in Frankfurt. It was based on the Audi quattro for the Rally sport developed and from autumn 1984 to summer 1985 in a number of only 220 units for the required FIA-homologation the Group B produced.</p>
<h2>body</h2>
    <p>ith the body, Audi was able to use the so-called modular system due to the large number of its models. The basis of the Sport quattro is the two-door up to the B-pillar Audi 80 sedan and from the B-pillar of the Audi quattro. The Sport quattro is 320 mm shorter than the Audi quattro. The side doors come entirely from the Audi 80. The tailgate consists of glass fiber reinforced Polyester resin, as it was used for the front spoiler of the Audi quattro. Fenders, side parts at the rear, roof, bonnet, front and rear apron were used by Seger and Hoffmann in the Switzerland manufactured and delivered. These parts consist of multi-layer Aramid tissue, Epoxy resinand various additions. The production and processing of this dimensionally stable, yet light material also made up a large part of the total costs of the Audi Sport quattro.</p>
<h2>engine</h2>
    <p>Never before, as here, in series automobile construction, have all the technical options for increasing performance been used side by side. In addition to the one already known from the Audi 200 Turbo and Audi quattro Exhaust gas turbocharging a cylinder head with four valves per cylinder was used in the Audi Sport quattro. In order to remain below 3 liters despite the so-called „ turbo factor “ specified for turbo engines in competition, the displacement was reduced from 2.144 to 2.133 liters by reducing the bore from 79.5 mm to 79.3 mm:

        2.144 l × 1.4 = 3.0016 l
        2.133 l × 1.4 = 2.9862 l
        This was important because vehicles with less than 3 liters displacement were allowed to weigh less than 1000 kg according to the regulations. In accordance with the function of the Audi Sport quattro as the planned winning car on national and international rally slopes, the overall concept of the engine was designed in such a way that, that a further increase in performance to 450 to 500 hp was relatively easy to achieve for sporting use.
        
        In order to compensate for the additional weight of the four-valve cylinder head and the larger turbocharger, the engine block was made of aluminum. In addition, a new, fully electronic injection system was used for the first time in a turbo engine from Audi at the Sport quattro.
        
        The engine of the Audi Sport quattro achieved an output of 225 kW ( 306 PS ) and 350 Nm Torque. The five-cylinder four-valve engine with K27 turbocharger from KK&K allowed a boost pressure of up to 2.04 bar.</p>

    <h1>Motorsport</h1>
    <p>Around 170 units were sold to private individuals by the Audi Sport quattro, but its actual purpose was to use the race in the World Rally Championship. He made his first appearance there at the Corsica rally of 1984. But the Sport quattro S1 initially proved to be relatively unwieldy. The engine also had to deal withtemperature problems, which have been resolved over time. At the Ivory Coast Rally in 1984 Stig Blomqvist pilot him through mud and dust to overall victory and thus for himself and Audi to both world championship titles. In 1985 the Sport quattro S1 contested its first full rally season. The signs of the times had already turned against Audi. The new, purebred Group B racing cars the competition was clearly superior to the sports quattro derived from a road car.</p>
    <p>However, Audi continued to develop a total of 20 copies of the Sport quattro, which were not based on the S1 version. The Sport quattro was provided with wings and spoilers using the FIA regulations for evolutionary versions and was then called Sport quattro E2. These spoilers gave him sufficient downforce both at high speeds and in curves. The Sport quattro E2 made its debut at the Olympus Rally ( at the time as an aspirant competition for the 1986 World Rally Championship ) in the USA, where Hannu Mikkola drove him to an impressive overall victory. Walter Röhrl then celebrated the only victory of a Sport quattro E2 in a World Championship run at the 1985 San Remo Rally. After an accident at the Rally Portugal 1986, in which 3 spectators were killed and 33 injured[ 6 ], Audi temporarily withdrew from the World Rally Championship.</p>
    <p>In 1987 Audi brought the „ short “ back to the racetrack. In the strongest version ever built by Audi itself. The Audi Sport quattro E2 Pikes Peak should write motorsport history together with Walter Röhrl. The vehicle was further improved aerodynamically compared to the „ normal “ E2. The engine also got additional performance. According to Audi, Walter Röhrl now had 598 hp available. Röhrl contested the vehicle with this vehicle Pikes Peak International Hill Climb in Colorado (USA). Audi won this as Race To The Clouds well-known mountain races already in 1984 ( Mouton / Pons, class victory ), 1985 ( Michèle Mouton, overall victory ) and 1986 ( Bobby Unser sen., Overall victory ). But in 1987 the competition should be particularly strong. In the end won Walter Röhrl with a 7 second lead over his strongest competitor Ari Vatanen in one Peugeot 205 T16 E2, who had to deal with technical problems shortly before the finish. Röhrl was also the first driver to win at Pikes Peak in less than 11 minutes. 10 minutes and 47.85 seconds set a new course record. To date, no other vehicle with a front engine has beaten this record.</p>
    <p>Audi followed this Mountain running back on gravel and some half-hearted experiments with the Audi 200 quattro from rallying and soon concentrated on circuit races. After the FIA banished Group B- „ Monster “ from the World Rally Championship at the end of 1986, some Sport quattro S1 and E2 continued to take part in the Auto sports Rallycross successfully participated in many races, for example under the Austrian Herbert Breiteneder. The most potent of them had high-pitched engines for the short sprint distances that are common here, the output of which was somewhere between 650 and 700 hp.</p>
